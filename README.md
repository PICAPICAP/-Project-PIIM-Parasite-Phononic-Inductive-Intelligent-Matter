# -Project-PIIM-Parasite-Phononic-Inductive-Intelligent-Matter
 A "Technical Joke" for a **Horizontal Phononic Pipeline** architecture. It parasitizes data center waste heat using IGZO tracks that flow *parallel* to RRAM field arrays. This achieves zero-power AI inference while protecting RRAM weight stability from thermal drift, utilizing VO2 phase-change logic gates for decision-making.
